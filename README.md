## Project: Exploratory Data Analysis on Haberman's Survival Dataset

### Overview:
Conducted detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the renowned Haberman's Survival Dataset to glean insights into the survival outcomes of breast cancer surgery patients.

### Key Features:
Dataset: Analyzed a dataset comprising 306 records, encompassing patient age, year of operation, number of positive axillary nodes, and survival status (1: survived, 2: did not survive).

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Employed statistical and visual analysis techniques to unveil patterns and correlations.
Created diverse visualizations (histograms, scatter plots, survival curves) to illuminate trends in the data.

-Insights and Recommendations:
Derived actionable insights, contributing valuable information for medical professionals and researchers.
Identified specific age groups and node count ranges associated with higher survival rates.

-Data Visualization:
Developed informative dashboards using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Communicated findings effectively through visually appealing charts and graphs.

### Tools Used:
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebooks

## Outcome:
Enhanced proficiency in exploratory data analysis, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The project contributes to the broader understanding of factors influencing the survival of breast cancer patients post-surgery.

## Key Takeaways:
This project demonstrates expertise in handling real-world datasets, conducting thorough data analysis, and effectively communicating findings through data visualizationâ€”a valuable asset in the field of data analysis. Insights and Recommendations:
